# Repository for CASH CALCULATOR JS website
## Intro
This project starts from an idea to transform a Javascript algorithm, developed while i was attending a course, in a real interface. The main task of the original ðŸ‘‰ Project, needed to achieve a Certification from FreeCodeCamp, was to Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. Cid is a 2D array listing available currency.
